`neuron morphology` is an open-source Python package for working with single-neuron morphological reconstruction data, such as those in the `Allen Cell Types Database <http://celltypes.brain-map.org>`_. It provides tools for transforming, analyzing, and visualizing these data. To get started, take a look at the `installation instructions <install.html>`_ and the `examples <examples.html>`_.

To report a bug or request a feature, see `the issues page <https://github.com/alleninstitute/neuron_morphology/issues>`_. For more information on the Allen Institute's morphological reconstruction data, see the `whitepaper <http://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/8323525/CellTypes_Morph_Overview.pdf>`_. If you have a question about these data, you can ask it on our `community forum <community.brain-map.org>`_
