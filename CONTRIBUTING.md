Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We are grateful for your work.

Workflow
--------

1. If the work is nontrivial, please make sure there is an  [issue](https://github.com/alleninstitute/neuron_morphology/issues) tracking it. This lets people know that you are interested in addressing this work and gives everyone a chance to weigh in on the appropriate solution.
2. Fork this repository. There should be a current release candidate branch with a name like `rc/X.Y.Z` (there will be a pull request open for the most recent release candidate). You should do your work in a feature branch based on the current release candidate.
3. When you are ready, open a pull request into the release candidate. Before doing so, please make sure that:
    - Any new code has new tests. The success of these tests implies that this code is working as intended.
    - All of the tests pass. You can check this by running `pytest tests` in your clone.
    - You have written documentation for all new code. This means docstrings at the very least. If you are implementing a substantial new feature, consider adding a long-form example notebook demonstrating its use.
    - Your code follows the [Google Python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
4. Address any review comments. Once enough reviewers have approved your pull request, a maintainer will merge it.
